### Just... Why?

Hi, I'm Ben; a technologist who is skeptical of technology. Now, don't get it confused with "I hate technology." I am just not a technovangelist like some people are. Don't get my wrong, I love technology; there just seems to be almost unlimited possibilities for it. But unlimited possibilites could also come with unlimited fuck ups. I like to think about the human aspect behind technology. There is no shortage of opinion on technology vs. humanity. How about a balance of both? So, there, another opinion out there and a bit of why I was driven to start this static site because I've no web developer skills. I also just wanted a place to note things down.

### Why Didn't You Just Use a Blogging Platform like Medium?

I'm on Medium actually. I just decided for a tech blog, I should use a static site and see if I muster up the energy to go into the bowels known as web development if I want to build upon this later. 

### Some Background

- Computer Science and Pure Math double degree from Bing U on Dec 2015 (Fancy but not really. He can theorize about problems, not solve them).
- Software Developer at a bank (Scary, possibly hypocritical).
- Heavily invested in all aspects about blockchain technology (Buzz, buzz, buzz).
- I eat books (Hipster).
- I'm a bit of a foodie (Hipster).
- I do digital and film photography (Unbelievably hispter).
- I also invest in the "regular" market (Meh).
- And as evidenced by what you're reading, I write a bit (If he gets anymore hipster...). 


### What Can You Expect To See Here?

- Thought essays about going through the computer science/technology space.
- Commentaries on certain goings on in tech.
- Tutorials on certain tech I experiment with.
- Project walkthroughs and lessons learned from those projects.
- References to (what I think to be) helpful resources.

And anything else related to tech that isn't coming to mind right now.

### Conclusion

The internet is a scary place and I want  my own little corner to think and reflect. Hopefully, some of you will find use of this little space. I also think having a place of experiences is good to always look back on and remember certain lessons because life (tech) moves at a breakneck pace and we can't remember everything.
