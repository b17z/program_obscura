My room is half library, half server so until I learn how to nicely present my bookshelves on a website, it will have to be a list of selected books/immediate reads to Amazon/other links. The presentation of this site is pretty much reflective of how my skills in front end presentation: non-existent. 

I named this portion "The Coffeeshop" because this is how I view modern day coffeeshops. I believe coffeeshops are places where people can talk, and exchange ideas from stuff they've read to projects they work on to just talking about philosophy. I like to dub it "The Coffeeshop Culture". I'll write about it more in detail and post it here. Of course, a lot of known thought leaders love doing extended walks but I believe this to be an extension of "The Coffeeshop Culture". It doesn't have to be in a physical coffeeshop but it's a philosophical mindset.
