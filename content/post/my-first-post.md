Hello All!

Welcome to my personal blog for all my musings related to tech and software engineering. I originally was using Medium to host all my content but I decided for a tech blog, I will try to get my hands a little dirty by using a static site generator to start out with. I plan on moving to my own custom site where I attempt to do all sorts of crazy things and make things overly complicated. But I will post everything I do here every step of the way! 

On this blog, you will find a few things:
- Step by step debacles throughout the durations of projects I undertake
- Lessons learned, step by step tutorials, explanations 
- My views on tech and software engineering related things
- Links to some articles I like or resources I think are helpful

So, come on and join me on this adventure!
Hope to see you all around!

Ben
